        <p>This is technically my 2nd webpage. Begun on 3,17,2022.</p>

        <p>To be used for <em>practice sessions</em> for TOP assignments.</p>

        <p><strong>2nd attempt</strong> - had to reference OG doc for every line.</p>
        
        <p>3rd attempt - referenced line 4.</p>  <!-- My attempt at creating paragraphs the first time did not run successfully. although I did nest everything according to the parent/child theory for easy readability. -->
    
        <p>I can now create paragraphs, <strong>BOLD TYPE</strong> and <em>italics</em> probably <strong><em>BOLD and italics</em></strong></p>

        <p>Now on 3,18,2022 I am using the extention "Go Live" in vscode.</p>
